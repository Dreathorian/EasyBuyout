# PoE item pricer

## What it does? 
When the user right-clicks an item in a public tab, this handy program instantly figures out the optimal price for it and outputs it.

## Who is it for?
Players who have little time on their hands and want to make some $$ without having to look up prices for every single item.
Be you a labrunner, who has dozens upon dozens of gems that need prices or a Uber Atziri farmer, who has amassed thousands of red tier maps, this program is perfect for you.

## "But I have PoeTradeMacro, why do I need this?"
Yeah and it's slow as s#!t. You hover over the item, click the hotkey, wait a bunch for it to load and then get a list of the cheapest prices.
Mind you, those might very well be pricefixers. 
Not with this program though. 
The prices are accurate and represent the average over a certain period of time.
Alls you gotta do is right click and you got your price set!

## "Okay so where do you get your prices from?"
Funny you should ask. I manage my own price database over at [poe.ovh](http://poe.ovh).
Take a look if you must.
