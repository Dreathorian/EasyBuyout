# Path of Exile item pricer

## What does it do?
When the user right-clicks an item in a premium tab (or any tab), this handy program instantly outputs a buyout note containing the average price for that type of item.

## Who is it for?
Players who have little time on their hands and want to make some $$ without having to look up prices for every single item.
Be you a labrunner, who has dozens upon dozens of gems that need prices or a Uber Atziri farmer, who has amassed thousands of red tier maps, this program is perfect for you.

## Sweet. Where can I get one?
Head on over to the [releases](https://github.com/siegrest/Pricer/releases/latest) page and grab the latest version.

## What can it price?
Uniques, gems, divination cards, maps, 6-links, currency, prophecies, essences, magic and rare items and pretty much everything.

## "But I have PoeTradeMacro, why do I need this?"
Yeah and it's slow as s#!t.
You hover over the item, click the hotkey, wait a bunch for it to load and then get a list of the cheapest prices.
Mind you, those might very well be pricefixers.
Not with this program though.
The prices are accurate and represent the average over a certain period of time.
Alls you gotta do is right click and you got your price set!

## "Okay so where do you get your prices from?"
Three main sources: [poe.ovh](http://poe.ovh), [poe.ninja](http://poe.ninja) and [poeprices](https://www.poeprices.info/) (as a fallback).
